### Accessing Settings
1. Click the ‚öôÔ∏è Settings button at the bottom of the popup
2. The settings page opens in a new tab with multiple configuration sections:

#### Schedule Settings
- Toggle "Enable scheduled sessions" to activate ZenMode automatically during specific times
- Enable "Auto-start ZenMode when Chrome opens" to start focus mode immediately on browser startup
- Click "Add Time Range" to create a new scheduled time slot
- For each time range, set:
  - Start and end times
  - Days of the week when this schedule should apply
  - Use the "√ó" button to remove a time range

#### Website Blocker
- View and manage your list of blocked websites
- Enter URL patterns in the input field and click "Add" to block new sites
- Use "*" for wildcards (e.g., "*facebook.com*" will block all Facebook URLs)
- Toggle individual sites on/off without removing them
- Use the "√ó" button to completely remove a site from your blocklist

- Your custom quotes will display randomly when you attempt to visit blocked sites

#### Security Settings

2. View statistics about your focus sessions:
   - Total sessions completed
   - Total hours focused
   - Average session duration
   - Current day streak
3. Filter your history by different time periods
4. See a detailed list of all your focus sessions
5. Download your work history as a CSV file for external analysis

## üîí Privacy

ZenMode operates completely locally on your browser. No data is sent to any external servers, and your settings and work history are stored only in Chrome's local storage.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working?
- Make sure Developer mode is enabled in Chrome Extensions
- Try reloading the extension from the Extensions page
- If the settings page doesn't open, reload Chrome and try again
- Clear extension data: go to the extension Details page and click "Clear data"

### Website Blocking Issues
- Ensure ZenMode is toggled on
- Check that your URL patterns are correctly formatted (include wildcards as needed)
- Verify the blocked site's toggle is enabled in Settings

### Timer or Sound Issues
- If the timer doesn't start, try reloading the extension
- For sound playback problems, check your browser's sound permissions

## Testing

ZenMode includes a comprehensive test suite built with Jest. These tests help ensure that the extension's functionality works correctly and prevents regressions when making changes.

### Running Tests

To run the tests:

```bash
# Run all tests once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (development)
npm run test:watch
```

### Test Structure

Tests are organized in the `src/__tests__` directory, which mirrors the structure of the source code:

- `src/__tests__/utils/` - Tests for utility functions
- `src/__tests__/background/` - Tests for background script functionality 
- `src/__tests__/popup/` - Tests for popup UI functionality

### Writing New Tests

When adding a new feature or modifying existing functionality, please add or update the corresponding tests. Here's a basic example of how to write a test:

```typescript
/**
 * @jest-environment jsdom
 */
/// <reference types="jest" />

import { featureToTest } from '../../path/to/feature';

describe('Feature description', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup code
  });

  it('should do something specific', () => {
    // Arrange
    const input = 'something';
    
    // Act
    const result = featureToTest(input);
    
    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe('expected output');
  });
});
```

### Mocking Chrome APIs

Chrome extension APIs are not available in the Jest test environment, so we need to mock them. The `jest.setup.js` file provides basic mocks for many Chrome APIs, but you may need to extend these for specific tests:

```typescript
// Example of mocking chrome.storage.local for a specific test
beforeEach(() => {
  chrome.storage.local.get = jest.fn().mockImplementation((key, callback) => {
    callback({ key: 'mockValue' });
  });
});
```
